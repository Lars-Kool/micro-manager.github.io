## NikonKS Camera Adapter


### Installation

First install the drivers for the cameras.  I have not found these to be publicly downloadable.  Ask your Nikon representative if you can not find them. I found the drivers on the computer provided by Nikon in the "Nikon Shared Drivers" directory.

Second, copy the file "DSCam.dll" from the DS-10-Fi3-Qi2-Ri2 SDK to the Micro-Manager installation directory (likely "C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager-2.0").  To get the SDK you need to register with Nikon as a developer at [https://nisdk.recollective.com](https://nisdk.recollective.com). You will also need to request the unzip password for this SDK.
