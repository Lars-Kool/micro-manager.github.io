# Elveflow - Micro-Manager

![Elveflow Microfluidic Devices](/media/elveflow_banner.png)

This document describes the configuration and operation of the [OB1 MK4](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-flow-control-systems/ob1-pressure-controller/), [MUX Wire](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-flow-control-systems/valve-controller/), and [MUX Distribution](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-flow-control-systems/mux-distrib/) devices for Micro-Manager.  

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ General UART Configuration and Communication Workflow

All devices communicate via **UART** with the following settings:  

| Parameter     | **OB1 MK4** | **MUX Wire** | **MUX Distribution** |
|---------------|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|
| **Baudrate**  | `115200`    | `115200`     | `9600`               |
| **Byte Size** | 8           | 8            | 8                    |
| **Parity**    | N           | N            | N                    |
| **Stop Bits** | 1           | 1            | 1                    |

If you want to communicate with the device without using an already implemeneted method :  

1. **Command Header**
   - Commands are started with this character `<`
2. **Command Type**
   - Using the device's UART documentation as a reference, select one of the 5 character long key word that correspond to a specific command.
3. **Command Formatting**  
   - The command type is always accompanied by a following character,  either `?` (GET) or `!` (SET) suffixes.  
4. **Parameters**
   - Some commands need parameters following the command formatting.
   - Written as `:1:2:3:`, each number corresponding to a parameter.
   - Refer to UART documentation delivered with your device.
5. **Sending Commands**  
   - Sent via UART with a newline (`\n`) termination.  
6. **Receiving Responses**  
   - Reads serial input and updates the `Response` property.
   - The response should start with a `>`.

For example, you coud send the following command to an [OB1 MK4 pressure controller](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-flow-control-systems/ob1-pressure-controller/) : `<PRESS!:0:100\n`. It would change the pressure of the first channel to 100 mbar.

| Property     | Description                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pos`        | Store target position                                         |
| `Direction`  | Set direction of rotation to go to target position            |
| `Response`   | Stored response from the device after a command has been sent |


### üõ† **Micro-Manager Available Method**

### üõ† **Micro-Manager Script Example**

```bsh
// Get list of devices 
mmcorej.StrVector devices = mmc.getLoadedDevices();

// Display list
print("");
for (int i = 0; i < devices.size(); i++) {
    String device = devices.get(i);
    print("Device : " + device);
}

// Setup UART command
String device_name = "MUX_DISTRIB";
int target_pos = 10;
int target_direction = 0; // 0 : left / 1 : right

// Send UART command
// -- First set IsGet and Parameters
mmc.setProperty(device_name, "Pos", target_pos);
mmc.setProperty(device_name, "Direction", target_direction); // It will trigger the function (GoToPos) to send completed UART command that move device to the target position with the selected direction
// -- Then specify the command
```
