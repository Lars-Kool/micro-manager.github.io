And also look at our
[paper](http://www.jbmethods.org/jbm/article/view/36/28) describing
hardware synchronization, simultaneous use of multiple cameras,
projection of patterned light onto a specimen, live slide mapping,
imaging with multi-well plates, particle localization and tracking, and
high-speed imaging.
