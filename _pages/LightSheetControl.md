**Summary:**

</td><td markdown="1">
This plugin was developed to facilitate synchronization of two stages in 
a lightsheet microscope (fixed sheet illumination from the side, main stage moves the sample through the sheet, second stage moves the objective to keep the 
sheet in focus).  It can be used for all uses of the [Utilities-MultiStage](Utilities) 
adapter to calibrate movement of the two stages.

### Operation


![](/media/LightSheetControl.png)


The following assumes that you have two stages, set as physical stages in the [Utilities-MultiStage device](Utilities). Move the first stage, for instance to the bottom of the sample, then move the second stage to get the sample in focus.  Press "Add Reference Point".  Move the sample up, refocus the second stage, add as a reference point, etc..  As you add points, the locations will be added to the graph in the bottom of the plugin and the the linear fit will be shown.  You probably do not gain much by adding more than ~5 or so reference points, but the graph should help you judge.

Control points can be saved to disk and re-loaded.  This may be useful, for instance, when using multiple objective lenses, each of which may have its own 
Multi-stage calibration.
