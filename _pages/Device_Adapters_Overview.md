Device adapters are the bridge between Micro-Manager and hardware devices like cameras, stages, and filter wheels. They translate Micro-Manager's standardized API calls into device-specific commands. This section will walk you through the process of creating a device adapter for your hardware, from setting up your development environment to implementing the required interfaces.

Whether you're a hardware manufacturer wanting to make your devices compatible with Micro-Manager or a researcher needing to integrate custom equipment, this guide provides the information you need to get started.
