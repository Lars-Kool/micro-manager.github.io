| Summary:         | Device Adapter for FLIR cameras that use the Spinnaker interface |
| Available since: | 2019                                                             |

The Spinnaker device adapter was created by
[CAIRN](https://www.cairn-research.co.uk).

## Installation


For Micro-Manager versions after 2021-03-08 (both 1.4 and 2.0 builds),
download and install the [Spinnaker V2.3.0.77
driver](https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/)
Though it was expected that Micro-Manager would
work with all versions 2 of Spinnaker, this is not the
case. Use version 2.3.0.77, which is available in the Spinnaker archive. 
For Micro-Manager versions prior to 2021-03-08, download and install the
[Spinnaker driver from the CAIRN
website](https://www.cairn-research.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SpinnakerSDK_FULL_1.20.0.15_x64.exe).

In the Spinnaker installer, you can choose "camera evaluation" or "Application development" (the latter 
includes more stuff you do not need if you do not build code yourself).  Make sure 
to select the driver for the type of camera you use (GigE, USB or USB legacy), I don't think it hurts to 
install all of them.  You will need the Visual Studio 2015 Runtime files, and it is nice to also install
"Spinview" to make sure the camera works.

There are (old) instructions in this [pdf on the CAIRN
website](https://www.cairn-research.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/READ-ME-INSTALLATION.pdf).
Note that it is not needed to download 2.0-beta3-20181129, newer
versions of Micro-Manager (1.4 and 2.0) work as well or better, and already
include the file mmgr\_dal\_Spinnaker.dll.

RGB8 mode results in RGB images as of build 2021-03-08. BGRa8 mode
(preferred for RGB if your camera has it) is supported as of 2021-03-09.
